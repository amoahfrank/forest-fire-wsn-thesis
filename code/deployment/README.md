# Deployment Architecture and Infrastructure Configuration

This directory encompasses the deployment configurations and infrastructure-as-code implementations for the forest fire detection system. The deployment strategy employs containerized microservices orchestration and cloud-native infrastructure provisioning methodologies.

## Deployment Architecture Overview

The deployment architecture implements a hierarchical approach, spanning edge computing nodes, fog layer processing, and cloud-based analytics infrastructure. This multi-tiered approach ensures optimal resource utilization and scalable system performance across varying operational environments.

### Container Orchestration Components

#### Docker Compose Configuration (`docker-compose.yml`)
- **Service Orchestration**: Defines multi-container application architecture
- **Network Configuration**: Internal service discovery and communication protocols
- **Volume Management**: Persistent data storage for time-series databases
- **Resource Allocation**: CPU and memory constraints for optimal performance

**Service Stack Components:**
- Node-RED flow engine container
- InfluxDB time-series database
- Grafana visualization platform
- MQTT broker (Eclipse Mosquitto)
- Custom API services

#### Cloud Infrastructure Provisioning (`cloudformation-template.yml`)
- **Infrastructure-as-Code**: AWS CloudFormation template for automated deployment
- **Resource Provisioning**: EC2 instances, VPC configuration, security groups
- **Auto-scaling Policies**: Dynamic resource scaling based on system load
- **High Availability**: Multi-AZ deployment for fault tolerance

### Deployment Strategies

#### Development Environment
- Local Docker Compose deployment for rapid development iteration
- Hot-reload capabilities for continuous development workflow
- Integrated debugging and monitoring tools

#### Production Environment
- AWS cloud deployment with automated CI/CD pipeline
- Kubernetes orchestration for enterprise-scale deployments
- Monitoring and logging infrastructure (CloudWatch, ELK stack)
- Security hardening and compliance configurations

### Infrastructure Requirements

**Minimum System Specifications:**
- CPU: 4 cores, 2.4 GHz
- Memory: 8 GB RAM
- Storage: 50 GB SSD
- Network: 100 Mbps internet connectivity

**Recommended Production Specifications:**
- CPU: 8 cores, 3.2 GHz
- Memory: 16 GB RAM
- Storage: 200 GB SSD (expandable)
- Network: 1 Gbps dedicated connection
- Backup: Automated daily backups with 30-day retention

### Security Considerations

Deployment configurations implement comprehensive security measures:
- Network segmentation and firewall configurations
- TLS/SSL encryption for all data transmission
- API authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Regular security patching and vulnerability assessments
