## Security Best Practices for Deployment

### Production Deployment

1. **Environment Isolation**
   ```bash
   # Use separate environments
   - Development: Limited access, test data
   - Staging: Production-like, restricted access
   - Production: Full security measures
   ```

2. **Secure Configuration**
   ```bash
   # Environment variables for sensitive data
   JWT_SECRET=cryptographically-strong-secret
   DATABASE_PASSWORD=complex-password
   API_ENCRYPTION_KEY=256-bit-key
   ```

3. **Network Configuration**
   ```bash
   # Firewall rules
   - Allow only necessary ports
   - Restrict administrative access
   - Use VPN for remote management
   ```

### Hardware Security
