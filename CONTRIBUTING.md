git commit -m "feat(sensors): add MQ-135 air quality sensor support"
git commit -m "fix(api): resolve MQTT connection timeout issue"
git commit -m "docs(readme): update deployment instructions"
```

### Pull Request Process

1. **Ensure Quality**
   - All tests pass: `npm test`
   - Code lints successfully: `npm run lint`
   - Documentation is updated
   - No merge conflicts with main branch

2. **Create Pull Request**
   - Use clear, descriptive title
   - Provide detailed description of changes
   - Reference related issues: `Fixes #123`
   - Include screenshots for UI changes

3. **Review Process**
   - Automated CI/CD checks must pass
   - Code review by maintainers
   - Address feedback promptly
   - Squash commits if requested
