## E.2 Solar Irradiance and Energy Availability Analysis

### E.2.1 Solar Resource Assessment

**Location Parameters:**
- Reference Location: Montreal, Canada (45.5°N, 73.6°W)
- Time Zone: UTC-5 (EST)
- Elevation: 56 meters above sea level
- Climate Classification: Humid continental (Köppen Dfb)

**Solar Position Calculations:**

The solar position is calculated using standard astronomical formulas:

**Solar Declination Angle (δ):**
```
δ = 23.45° × sin(360° × (284 + n)/365°)
```
Where n = day of year (1-365)

**Equation of Time (E):**
```
E = 9.87 × sin(2B) - 7.53 × cos(B) - 1.5 × sin(B)
B = 360° × (n - 81)/365°
```

**Solar Time Angle (ω):**
```
ω = 15° × (Solar Time - 12:00)
Solar Time = Standard Time + E/60 + (Standard Meridian - Local Longitude)/15°
```

**Solar Elevation Angle (α):**
```
sin(α) = sin(δ) × sin(φ) + cos(δ) × cos(φ) × cos(ω)
```
Where φ = latitude = 45.5°

**Solar Azimuth Angle (γ):**
```
sin(γ) = cos(δ) × sin(ω) / cos(α)
```

```

### E.6.2 Solar Energy Generation

**Monthly Energy Generation Calculations:**

For each month, the daily energy generation is:
```
E_gen_daily = Panel_Power × Hours_sunlight × Derating_factors
```

Derating factors include:

## E.7 Battery Autonomy Calculations

### E.7.1 Worst-Case Scenario Analysis

**Consecutive Cloudy Days Analysis:**

Assuming no solar input for extended periods:

**Battery Capacity Available:**
```
E_available = 18.72 Wh × 0.8 = 14.98 Wh
(80% depth of discharge to preserve battery life)
```

**Autonomy Calculation:**
```
Autonomy = E_available / P_consumption
Autonomy = 14.98 Wh / 3.86 Wh/day = 3.88 days
```

**Extended Autonomy with Reduced Power Mode:**

In power-saving mode (reduced sensor frequency, communication intervals):
- Power consumption reduced to: 95.2 mW (2.28 Wh/day)
- Extended autonomy: 14.98 Wh / 2.28 Wh/day = 6.57 days

### E.7.2 Seasonal Autonomy Analysis

**Winter Solstice (December 21) - Worst Case:**

Daily solar energy: 32.1 Wh
Daily consumption: 3.86 Wh
Net daily surplus: 28.2 Wh

Even on the shortest day with overcast conditions (20% of clear-sky irradiance):
Solar energy: 32.1 × 0.2 = 6.4 Wh
Daily deficit: 3.86 - 6.4 = -2.54 Wh (battery provides surplus)

Consecutive days without adequate solar input:
14.98 Wh / 2.54 Wh/day = 5.9 days

## E.8 System Optimization and Design Trade-offs

### E.8.1 Panel Size Optimization

**Trade-off Analysis:**

| Panel Size (W) | Cost ($) | Weight (kg) | Daily Energy (Wh) | Winter Autonomy (days) | Cost/Performance |

- Provides adequate autonomy
- Minimal system complexity
- Cost-effective solution
- Suitable system voltage (7.2V nominal)

## E.9 Environmental Impact Considerations

### E.9.1 Shading Analysis

**Partial Shading Effects:**

Forest deployment involves potential shading from:
- Tree canopy (seasonal variation)
- Moving shadows throughout day
- Snow accumulation (winter)

**Shading Impact Model:**
```
P_shaded = P_unshaded × (1 - S_factor)
```

Where S_factor varies by shading type:

| Shading Type | S_factor | Power Reduction (%) |
|--------------|----------|-------------------|
| Light canopy | 0.15 | 15% |
| Medium canopy | 0.35 | 35% |
| Dense canopy | 0.55 | 55% |
| Snow cover | 0.90 | 90% |

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. Panel placement in clearings when possible
2. Elevated mounting to reduce ground-level shading
3. Regular cleaning/maintenance schedule
4. Bypass diodes to minimize partial shading losses

### E.9.2 Soiling and Maintenance

**Soiling Loss Model:**

Daily soiling accumulation in forest environment:
```
S(t) = S_max × (1 - e^(-t/τ))
```

Where:
- S_max = 8% (maximum soiling loss)
- τ = 30 days (time constant)
- t = days since last cleaning

**Impact on Energy Production:**

| Days Since Cleaning | Soiling Loss (%) | Daily Energy Impact (Wh) |
|-------------------|------------------|-------------------------|
| 0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| 7 | 1.8 | 0.9 |
| 14 | 3.4 | 1.8 |
| 30 | 5.0 | 2.6 |
| 60 | 6.9 | 3.6 |
| 90 | 7.6 | 4.0 |

**Recommended Cleaning Schedule:**
- Monthly cleaning during growing season
- Quarterly cleaning during dormant season
- Post-storm inspection and cleaning as needed

## E.10 Economic Analysis

### E.10.1 Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE)

**LCOE Calculation:**

```
LCOE = (Initial Cost + PV(O&M) + PV(Replacement)) / PV(Energy Production)
```

**System Parameters:**
- Initial cost: $45.20 (panel + MPPT + mounting)
- O&M cost: $5.00/year
- Replacement cost: $28.00 (panel) at year 15
- System lifetime: 20 years
- Discount rate: 5%

**Energy Production:**
- Annual energy: 1,434 kWh
- 20-year total: 28,680 kWh (accounting for degradation)

**LCOE Calculation:**
```
LCOE = ($45.20 + $62.31 + $11.64) / 24,378 kWh = $0.0049/kWh
```

### E.10.2 Payback Analysis vs Grid Power

**Grid Power Alternative:**
- Grid connection cost: $2,500
- Monthly service charge: $15
- Energy cost: $0.12/kWh

**Solar System ROI:**
```
Payback Period = Initial Investment / Annual Savings
Annual Savings = ($15 × 12 + $0.12 × 3.86 × 365) - $5.00 = $348.24
Payback Period = $45.20 / $348.24 = 0.13 years (1.6 months)
```

## E.11 Reliability and Degradation Analysis

### E.11.1 Solar Panel Degradation

**Long-term Performance Model:**

```
P(t) = P_0 × (1 - d_annual)^t
```

Where:
- P_0 = initial power (10W)
- d_annual = 0.006 (0.6% annual degradation)
- t = years

**20-Year Performance Projection:**

| Year | Power Output (W) | Efficiency (%) | Annual Energy (kWh) |
|------|------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| 1 | 10.00 | 19.0 | 1.434 |
| 5 | 9.71 | 18.4 | 1.393 |
| 10 | 9.42 | 17.9 | 1.351 |
| 15 | 9.14 | 17.4 | 1.311 |
| 20 | 8.87 | 16.9 | 1.273 |

### E.11.2 System Reliability Analysis

**Component Failure Rates:**

| Component | MTBF (years) | Failure Rate (/year) | Replacement Cost ($) |
|-----------|--------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Solar Panel | 25 | 0.040 | 28.00 |
| MPPT Controller | 10 | 0.100 | 5.20 |
| Wiring/Connections | 20 | 0.050 | 8.00 |
| Mounting Hardware | 30 | 0.033 | 12.00 |

**System Reliability:**
```
R_system(t) = e^(-λ_total × t)
λ_total = 0.223/year
R_system(5 years) = e^(-0.223 × 5) = 0.328 (32.8%)
```

**Expected Maintenance Costs:**

| Year | Probability of Failure | Expected Maintenance Cost ($) |
|------|----------------------|-------------------------------|
| 1-5 | 0.672 | 10.80 |
| 6-10 | 0.893 | 14.35 |
| 11-15 | 0.973 | 15.64 |
| 16-20 | 0.995 | 15.98 |
